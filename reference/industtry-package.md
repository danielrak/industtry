# industtry: A Toolkit for Structured Datasets Exploitation

This package proposes a set of functions that helps exploiting
structured datasets (mostly data frames) with an industrialization
approach. Industrialization here means applying as efficiently as
possible the same procedure to any number of inputs as long as these
inputs have an identified common structure.
