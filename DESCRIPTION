Description: A toolkit for structured datasets exploitation. A set of
    functions that helps exploiting structured datasets (data frames) with
    an industrialization approach.  Industrialization here means applying
    as efficiently as possible the same procedure to any number of inputs
    as long as these inputs have an identified common structure.
