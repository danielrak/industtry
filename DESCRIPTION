Description: A toolkit for structured datasets exploitation. A set of functions that helps 
    exploiting structured datasets (data frames) with an industrialization approach. 
    Industrialization here means applying as efficiently as possible the same
    procedure to any number of inputs as long as these inputs have an identified common structure.
