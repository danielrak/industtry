WARNING: This package, even if it acquired some maturity, is still in development. Contributions are welcome. 

This package intends to be a toolkit for structured datasets exploitation. 
Included functions help exploiting structured datasets (principally data frames) with an industrialization approach. 
Industrialization here means applying as efficiently as possible the same procedure to any number of inputs as long as these inputs have an identified common structure.
